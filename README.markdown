This is a fork of Sumeet Jain's [jQuery Markdown Footnotes].

## What's different

* Sumeet's original appeared to work with [PHP Markdown Extra]. I have changed it to work with the footnote output of [MultiMarkdown].
* I have moved the styling options out of the `.js` file and into a `.css` file for easier styling (for me anyway).
* It's more mobile friendly. Especially with long footnotes.

[PHP Markdown Extra]: http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/
[MultiMarkdown]: http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/

## To do

* Put comments in the `.js` file to illustrate how to make it work with [PHP Markdown Extra] again.
* Clean up `.css` file and comment mandatory and user-changeable styles.
